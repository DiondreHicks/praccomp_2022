## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
Medicinal_plants_COVID_19_Cusco_English
#install.packages("ggplot2")
```
```{r}
med_plant <- Medicinal_plants_COVID_19_Cusco_English
```

```{r}
string <- str(med_plant)
#table(str($))
barplot(table(df$Use.for.prevention), main= "Plants Used for Prevention", ylab="Number of People", xlab ="Responses", col = c("red", "blue") )
```
```{r}
barplot(table(df$Use.for.treatment), xlab="Responses", ylab="Nubmer of Patients", col=c("red","blue"), )
```

```{r}
#install.packages("plotrix")
#library(plotrix)
table(df$Use.for.treatment)
x <- c(506, 1241)
piepercent <- round(100*x/sum(x), 1)
pie(x, labels= piepercent, main= "Covid-19 Treated With Medicinal Plants", col= rainbow(length(x)))
legend("topright", c("No", "Yes"), cex = .8, fill = rainbow(length(x)))
```
